<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>Due to an increase in the number of homeless people, street crime is on the rise. We hear about street crime on a daily basis. Women confront difficulties while going out late at night. To combat this, we have developed a web application that allows users to save and browse safe and risky areas based on their own personal experiences.</p>
    
    <h2>What it does</h2>
    <p>The app will have a map-like user interface that will highlight the severity of crimes as you go across the area. To help the homeless even more, we have a contribution option that allows any user to contribute any clothes or food to them as long as they know their location through the web application.</p>
